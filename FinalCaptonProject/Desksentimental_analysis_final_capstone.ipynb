    "# Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "* <h6>What is the problem you are attempting to solve?</h6>\n",
    "    * Movie reviews are subjective attitudes, emotions and opinions of people and a sentiment extracts information from these reviews. This sentiment analysis will neatly categorize people's sentiment as positive, negative or neutral and provide a topic summary. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* <h6>How is your solution valuable?</h6>\n",
    "    * Movie rating doesn't capture the nuances of the opinions and no one wants to sit and read thousands of reviews. These insights can be used to business decisions such as direct marketing, recommendation system, future project directions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* <h6>What is your data source and how will you access it?</h6>\n",
    "\t* IMDb movie reviews, using scrapy web scraper.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* <h6>What techniques from the course do you anticipate using?</h6>\n",
    "\t* Web scraping (scrapy): to get the data\n",
    "\t* Natural language processing (spaCy): to process the data and to create features \n",
    "\t* word2vec (Continuous Bag of Words): converting words to vectors\n",
    "\t* Neural Network: to analyze the data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* <h6>What do you expect to be the biggest challenge you’ll face?</h6>\n",
    "\t* Web scraping is new to me and it seems you need some understanding of web development.\n",
    "\t* Feature creation: sentence negation, sarcasm, terseness, language ambiguity, slang, misspellings, and many others make this task very challenging.\n",
    "\t* Neural Network optimization: adjusting hyperparameters\n",
    "    * Evaluating results: first stragey is to compare it to existing ratings.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Problem Description: \n",
    "* What is the problem that you will be investigating? Why is it interesting?\n",
    "* Data: What data will you use? If you are collecting new datasets, how do you plan to collect them?\n",
    "* Methodology/Algorithm: What method or algorithm are you proposing? If there are existing implementations, will you use them and how? How do you plan to improve or modify such implementations?\n",
    "* Related Work: What reading will you examine to provide context and background?\n",
    "* Evaluation Plan: How will you evaluate your results? Qualitatively, what kind of results do you expect (e.g. plots or figures)? Quantitatively, what kind of analysis will you use to evaluate and/or compare your results (e.g. what performance metrics or statistical tests)?"
