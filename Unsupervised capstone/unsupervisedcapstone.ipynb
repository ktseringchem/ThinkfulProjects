    "There are too many movies and too many people with opnion on them. Its doubtful that any one would want to read these reviews, certly not companies that need to do it therefore cluster to get the jest of what is going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Source\n",
    "This dataset contains movie reviews along with their associated binary sentiment polarity labels. It is intended to serve as a benchmark for sentiment classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core dataset contains 50,000 reviews split evenly into 25k train and 25k test sets. The overall distribution of labels is balanced (25k pos and 25k neg). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the entire collection, no more than 30 reviews are allowed for any given movie because reviews for the same movie tend to have correlated ratings. In the labeled train/test sets, a negative review has a score <= 4 out of 10, and a positive review has a score >= 7 out of 10. Thus reviews with more neutral ratings are not included in the train/test sets."

      " I made the big mistake of actually watching this whole a few nights ago. God Im still trying to recover. This does not even deserve a . average. IMDb needs to have vote ratings possible for movies that really deserve it like this one. . is TOO HIGH. I had heard how awful this was, but I really did not think a could actually be that bad, especially in this day and era. I figured all of the cheesy god awful movies were only from the s and s. My god was I wrong. Trust me folks, this REALLY IS THAT BAD. It is beyond horrible; it is beyond pathetic; it is beyond any type of word that I can think of for it. BATTLEFIELD EARTH looks like Best Picture of the Year compared to this movie. SNAKE ISLAND which up until now was the worst Id ever seen looks like it deserves a few Oscars compared to this pathetic effort. I seriously can not believe that the makers of this thought this was a legitimate serious effort of producing a Hollywood movie. This has no business being called a movie. In the first seconds of the film, I seriously thought I was watching some high school theater class attempting to make a short movie. Or better yet, I thought it was some Saturday night Live ripoff skit of the real thing. I mean, it looks exactly like that. The acting is horrible; the whole almost looks like it was shot with a year old VHS video camera. the special effects.......well good lord Bewitched from back in the day had better special effects than this movie. The scene where he gets shot at the door is beyond laughable and beyond cheesy. I mean seriously, my Intro to Acting class from years ago in college, all of us could have put together a better than this. And the worst part of the entire movie, where Arthur is naked in the bathroom. Oh my god I almost thew up right there. I have a strong stomach, but wow that was horrible. Some people should never be naked, and hes one of them. The plot of this just seems to go absolutely nowhere. They talk about legal issues that we never hear about again; Ben talks about getting into music that we never hear about again; arthur says he is looking for a job and money for college and the next thing we see is hes running a porn shop. Everything about the is just horrible. This really doesnt have much to do with my critique, but just so everyone knows, I am not a gay man. I DO however support gay rights and believe we should all be treated as equals. And I would support any gay person in my church, unlike the cruel priest in this movie, who by the way seems to cuss every other word. WHERE IS THE F#ing white out hahaha But I didnt want anyone to think I hated this just because of it being about two gay guys. It has nothing to do with that This would have been just as horrible of a if it was Ben Jill instead of Ben Arthur. I just watched this to see if it really was as bad as they say. And yes it was even WORSE than I had read. Let this be a warning to everyone ONLY watch this if you want to just sit back and laugh at how pathetic some movies in the st century can still be. If you watch this and are actually expecting a good or some entertainment, I have no sympathy for you whatsoever. On a final thought How in the world are there movies ranked BELOW this on IMDb There is no way there are movies out there that are worse than this!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0.387072\n",
      " Isnt anyone else tired of that old cliché where a nearly dead person shows up in a horror film, gives us some informations, and then blasts his head off for no apparent reason I know I am. The sad thing is that its use in this is worthless. If you have seen the first the first remake I should say then the information given is completely worthless, because you would have already known it. I guess, you can that it isnt worthless to the main characters..but then why does the idiot shoot himself in the head Wouldnt he want to live Sure, he would have died anyway.. This is the second to be titled The Hills Have Eyes II. The first being the sequel to the original s film. This is where it gets a little complicated for someone like me. See, Im probably part of minority of people my age that even knew there was a HHE to begin with, much less an original HHE. And now that we have a sequel to a remake and the fact that this sequel is named exactly as the sequel to the original HHE...it just makes it worse! But anyways.. Wes Cravens original Hills Have Eyes was decent. In the end, though, the idea was better than the presentation, but he most likely had a low budget. To be quite honest, Wes Craven isnt that good of a horror director. Hes only made a few good horror movies Nightmare on Elm St., New Nightmare, a few alright ones Scream and a bunch of horrible ones Cursed, Shocker, Vampire in Brooklyn. Oh yeah, and he made Swamp Thing, as well...but the original HHE falls under the latter category. Ive only seen a few minutes, but it was terrible. Now he has cowritten the new HHE..and its such a disappointment! Last years HHE remake was even better than the original film. It was tense. I guess it had to do with the fact that the main characters were a family, and not a bunch of beer and pot and sex crazy teenagers. It made us feel dirty. For the first hour, we were in hell, and finally in the last few moments, the good guys got revenge on the bad guys and it felt good.. This new has no tension. No suspense whatsoever. Just violent things happening to mostly stupid people. There is hardly any menacing presence here. Just ugly hobos hiding under rocks. Im getting tired of horror movies where people die because of the stupid mistakes they keep making. It was just the other day that I watching Deep Blue Sea where Samuel L. Jackson kept on walking around the water, while giving the speech, and then he gets eaten by a shark, only because the idiot stayed to close to the water..something that nobody would do in the given situation! Here is the exact same thing. People go off by themselves to take a leak even though they know people are dying..seriously, couldnt a potty break wait And then when you think people would have learned, someone else goes of by themselves! Seriously, isnt more scary when the characters are bringing their Agame and still losing I would think so... It even under delivers. It should have made the first remake look like The Fog remake which was less menacing than an episode of Becker. More bad guys. More time in the caves. More tension. More of everything. But it actually downgrades. Less bad guys. No tension. Sure we have more time in the caves, but not a whole lot happens there. In the end, it only seems like there is two or three bad guys. The last made it seem like a whole tribe of people. Where is this tribe Who keeps on watching them through binoculars Seriously, these are the things this should have brought us, but it ends with the exact same promise that the last gave us, with that exact same being watched scene. Come on! Ill give the devil its due. The look of the is good..but thats it. I dont even think fans of gore will like this..though Im probably wrong! There is gore though most of it is spedup while in the dark, but without the tension, and characters you even care about..the gore does nothing in my book! In the end, youre not frightened. You;re not shocked unless youre an year old girl. You dont even feel like you have seen anything new.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0.367779\n",
      " The premise of this has been tickling my imagination for quite some time now. Weve all heard or read about it in some kind of context. What would you do if you were all alone in the world What would you do if the entire world suddenly disappeared in front of your eyes In fact, the last part is actually what happens to Dave and Andrew, two roommates living in a rundown house in the middle of a freeway system. Andrew is a nervous wreck to say the least and Dave is considered being one of the biggest losers of society. That alone is the main reason to why these two guys get so well along, because they simply only have each other to turn to when comforting is needed. Just until... Straight from the beginning of the lots and lots of problems happen to them. Both of them get involved with crime, Andrew suffers from paranoia and simply doesnt dare going out of the house. Dave is unsuccessful at his job and his colleagues dont treat him very well and with the respect he deserves. The amount of problems they face keeps increasing until that one day where they may have to face the inevitable and deal with it. This is just too much for them and they wish that everything would just go away... And of course that is exactly what happens. The rest of the story places Dave and Andrew in this world of nothingness. At first they are surprised and have problems understanding and dealing with the features of this crazy environment, but later on they find out that they can do just about everything they want because it seems as if they are the only ones still left. Nothing features an incredibly small cast in fact, besides the first couple of shots from the film, we only see Dave David Hewlett and Andrew Andrew Miller in the entire film. It is clear that in order to pull this off, the cast has to be more than up for the task, because in a world where nothing exists there is nothing that can distract the viewer in any way. Vincenzo has decided to use a reasonable amount of closeup head shots to make it more interesting and it actually works quite well. Director of Photography, Derek Rogers, also has a nice way of teasing the audience by withholding visual information, especially at times where a character sees something and reacts to it, but we dont see it right away. Obviously, this cant be an event driven and its not. Much of the action happens outside their house when they move around in the void. And thats where some of the most hilarious scenes take place, especially in the case of when Andrew discovers a candy bar. Now, one could be thinking How does nothing look like Well, it looks like nothing indeed. The entire world of nothing is white... white no matter in what direction you look. This is the weakness of this film... After an hour or less its getting extremely boring to look at and there has to be events to make sure its more interesting to look at. Thank God, there are some. For example at times when the two lads, due to the properties of nothing, are able to jump really high as if nothing is made out of... tofu as Andrew claims. Its fun to see how they are instantly able to use nothing to become gods of their own little society. One of the best parts of the is the set... Production designer Jasna Stefanovic has done a beautiful job in this film, the house in which these two guys live is so unnaturally fun to look at, still it seems right for these two to be living in a place like this. All in all, the production design is with no doubt one of the most powerful aspects of this at it really makes the worth watching... However, the very best part of the is the acting. Both David Hewlett and Andrew Miller really look like the professional actors they both are. The camera is on them for every second of the and as previously said, there are just about no props in the film, they are really on a bare stage. With plenty of character development and some decent oneliners, clever dialogue at times hilariously stupid, it all works to that end and this really moves the away from the lowbudget area to wellcrafted handwork. Lets talk a little about the visual effects, because they are definitely worth mentioning. Nothing features digital visual effects and prosthetics that equals any modern horror film. Theres a rather horrifying dream sequence in the film, and although The Drews have milked that scene completely its still fun to watch. One of the best visual effects in the is at the end where Andrew and Dave suddenly discover their powers in this environment they have the abilities to wish everything away, so what if they can do it the other way around and make things appearbr Nothing is a bright and welllit movie, it really helps promoting the idea of them probably being dead this is in fact one of their theories, but Nothing is a comedy and it slowly destroys its own theory. We dont know where they are or what has happened to them. We dont know if they will ever get out, because the ends before we see anything like that. The ending, by the way, is not as good as it couldve been. Its rather easy to predict what is going to happen, still the writers have thought up a few incidents that help make it a little more interesting and in the end, its a reasonably satisfactory one. Take Hollow Man, Kill Bill, Cube, Epoch and lots of other films and you have Nothing. It really is an amalgam of different styles, still there is no other at least that I know of Nothing is really like. For the people remembering the original Cube Production Commentary on its DVD may remember that Vincenzo Natali talked about how he came up with the story of Cube. He talks about him and André Bijelic having been roommates at a time and they both were in this extremely dull room with no hope of getting out, Nothing could very well be the screened version of the origin of the Cube story, and to that end, its almost like one of the Cube prequels. What can I say I enjoyed Nothing, it is a great and the different parts of the are extremely wellmade with tons of intelligent ideas, still I feel the is missing something and I have problems finding out precisely what it is... Maybe if we have a Nothing I can answer that question. Nothing is a great film, but not as good as I expected it to be. Final rating .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0.340097\n",
      " This is a remake of two movies that were a lot better. The last one, Heaven Can Wait, was great, I suggest you see that one. This one is not so great. The last third of the is not so bad and Chris Rock starts to show some of the comic fun that got him to where he is today. However, I dont know what happened to the first two parts of this movie. It plays like some really bad B where people sound like they are in some bad TV sitcom. The situations are forced and it is like they are just trying to get the story over so they can start the real movie. It all seems real fake and the editing is just bad. I dont know how they could release this like that. Anyway, the last part isnt to bad, so wait for the video and see it then.

      " lot of people seemed to have liked the film, so I feel somewhat bad giving it a bad review. But after sitting through minutes of it, I feel I have to do so. Where the heck is the plot in this film! I must have missed it, I was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened. Sure the ending was somewhat shocking but they didnt build up to it. I forgot who was who half of the time, so they didnt really develop the characters. The acting was soso, most of the time it was believable, but I was able to see through it most of the time. So... without giving anything away, I must say that unless you like the actors in the film, there is no real reason to watch this movie. I could be mistaken, but I just didnt understand why there was so little, or too much of the film. I cant decide which one that would be, so I say judge for yourselves. I dont even know if renting it would be a good idea, the cost and all... Plot Characters Acting Overall I feel like thats too high really, I am staying with my vote up at the top.

      " I love a good war and I fall into the been there, done that category. So I would like to think my review is an accurate one IMHO. Having just watched this on DVD I can safely say that it was a pile of rubbish. There is no way I can recommend this to you. It started off with me shouting at the TV saying you wouldnt do that etc...but I soon realised that having a bit of job experience would be a hindrance so I chilled a bit. But on the opening scene when the trailer wheel fell off I got a nasty feeling that this would be a predictable dud...I was right. There simply wasnt any logic to the EOD scenes. I just know that the army team had some of the most patient insurgents ever at the other end of the command wire or remote trigger. So much so I was left scratching my head all the time. Then just when you think you know where the story is going the guys in the Humvee are off out on their own driving around the desert. One of the most valuable assets in theatre out on a jolly bumping into some SAS wannabe contractors. The sniper scene was just so laughable. It just made no sense at all and made me want to switch off there and then. Then for them to drag it out so long really did test my patience.It started with the Contact Right and went down hill fast. If you had a Brit accent then you got shot but if you were part of the EOD team then suddenly you were a great shot and saved the day. Then just as you thought it was over it stretched on for an inexplicably long period without adding anything to the story at all. You are just left watching and asking why hasnt it ended yetbr Then we had the booze scene where they just hit each other for a laugh..another scene where you just wanted it to end. It added nothing to the film. Then just as my life seemed very dull the main star went outside the wire to hunt someone down. This most be the most ridiculous scene I have ever watched. It defied all logic and ability to write a good storyline...it was senseless and awful. I still dont understand why they wasted time on it. Then to watch him just jog through the busy streets heading back to camp had me rolling on the floor with laughter. Pure comedy The sad fact is that this storyline is all over the show without really deciding what it wants to be. I thought it was going to be stupid illogical EOD scenes but then it kept going off on tangents trying to be something different. But as hard as it tried it just bored me to death. All I wanted was for it to end. It was a messy compilation of stupid scenes mixed into a batch of stupid, senseless, actionish scenes. There is no way I can recommend this. Maybe my work experience compromised the enjoyability but even the naive must realise this just doesnt make sense. The only thing more stupid than this is the artificially high IMDb rating...which must be the work of the box office PR team who seem to use this website as a way of making everyone think it is good. Sorry folks...it just aint! Not recommended...it will just bore you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0.329612\n",
      " I dont know why people except a lot from low budget indie films but I enjoyed this one as Im a fan of urban horror. Theres not too many urban horror movies out there so when I saw this one on the shelf, just the title alone peaked my curiosity. So I decided to check it out and I was surprised...its not too often you run into a low budget indie horror with GREAT acting and a good story. Is it low budget yes. Can you tell that its low budget Yes...but once you start watching the you become so wrapped up in the story that it doesnt matter. I like hip hop music too and the soundtrack is nice! I dont know whats up with all these bad reviews for this film. All I hear is worst ever. Have these idiots seen EVERY out there Theres thousands of movies out there, how can you categorize one as the worst ever video not like zombiez may be the worst I ever SEEN but I cant say that its the worst EVER since I havent seen every out there. Bottom line these people who gave this bad reviews are probably from the suburbs. Listen, if you dont like minority based, urban films, the ghetto films, hip hop,etc then WHY WATCH THESE TYPES OF MOVIES!!! knowing that you dont like this type of stuff Sure, this is a horror but its not just a horror but its an URBAN horror with a multicultural based cast. I dont like TV shows like Dawsons Creek or the O.C., THEY SUCK to me. Films like Garden State, Wedding Crashers and I heart huckabees SUCK to me. Im a guy from New Jersey and these shows and movies suck to me. Why Because I cant relate to them. They dont peak my interest. Just common sense. Believe me, I will never watch GARDEN STATE GARDEN SALAD, WEDDING CRASHERS Heres a sequel to torture you again since the first sucked so bad and I HEART HUCKABORING. Now back to this movie, in regards to saints comment above, I dont know if this guy was smoking crack or got knocked stupid by his drunken dad before he watched the but to me, everyone did a great job. The actor who played Ricky I forgot his name did a VERY good job. Im an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and I had to do a play where I had to cry and its not easy to be emotional in a scene so I give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it off. Anywho, I liked this and never heard of these actors and directors before but you bet Ill be looking out for their stuff for now on and if they are reading this, BRING ON THE SEQUEL!!! Im out.

      " I mark where there are spoilers! Overall comments If you can take a serious movie, go see this. Have an open mind and you will enjoy it. Dont leave the theater because you get confused as to what is going on! The fits together nicely in the second half. I will be taking my mom to see it again when the officially opens. I was lucky to see this at a screening a couple of weeks ago, when Will was going around promoting the movie. He was greatspent a lot of time with the fans. Thank you for the picture Will! About Wills performance lot of times when you see a with an actor really famous for some other movieshow, you always think of them in their current performance much like you think of them for their past performance. This is not the case with Will Smith in this movie. I didnt picture the Fresh Prince lol when I was watching this movie. He was completely and utterly convincing in this very, very serious role. He has grown immensely as an actor. I think he will at least get an Oscar nod for this performance. About his character Ben is very conflicted and tormented. Hes sad...guiltridden...very determined, but very scared. Very true to himself. His character has a lot of depth...and somehow, Will managed to bring that to life. About Emily Rosario Rosario did a nice job portraying Emily, a woman very much behind on her taxes. Maybe shes not the shining star Will is in this movie, but she was very convincing. I think her character just did not have as much to work with as Wills did. About the plot no spoilers I admit that I did NOT like the until the second half of it. I knew absolutely nothing about the going into it, and nothing made sense until the second part of it or so. But when things eventually fit together, wow. Surprisingly well written and well thought out. Its an extremely intense that really sticks with you. It actually takes a lot out of you to watch. In the theater I was in, most people were crying towards the endeven grown men. When you realize what Ben is doing, and why, its a very powerful moment... Minor SPOILERS Which is why its really hard to talk about the plot without giving major things away. I feel like knowing too much about this really ruins it. There was a lot of symbolism in the that I enjoyed, though. I will mention some of it here without trying to give a lot away. The fish that Ben was keeping in his hotel room. At first, it makes no sense whatsoever. There was a LOT of chatter in the theater when people realized the reality of the fish. I hated Ben at the beginning of the movie. By the end of it, I loved him and hated him. Thats how convincing Will was. I thought Ben was being a huge jerk to Ezra, a blind man just trying to make his way in the world. Why he was treating Ezra like that also became abundantly clear later in the movie. Wait it out though. Everything in this wait it out. Ben is a fundamentally good person who made a big mistake that he wont forgive himself for. Its still unclear to me if he was doing what he was doing because he was trying to rid himself of his own guilt, or if he genuinely wanted to help people. I think its a little bit of both...I think he wanted to help people but also rid himself of his past. I love his character. You love him and hate him because you realize that what he is doing is nothing short of amazing. You hate him because of what he is doing to himself as a very good person, both physically and emotionally. Nice job Will.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0.325680\n",
      " Me and a friend rented this because it sounded really good. But we were wrong. First of the acting....wow...the acting was the worst, the effects were really bad as well, it seemed like a a college kid made. The plot was pretty good, but itd been done. The thing that ruined the movies the most were the actors. The main guy was the worst actor ever...its a shame Im even calling him an actor...The only good thing about this was it was so bad it was funny...so if you want a good laugh see it....but other than that...stay far away from this one. I usually love B list movies and such, but this one... I do not know how it was passed to even be put on video...this one is the worst Ive seen..and Ive seen some bad ones.

      " Warning Does contain spoilers. Open Your Eyesbr If you have not seen this and plan on doing so, just stop reading here and take my word for it. You have to see this film. I have seen it four times so far and I still havent made up my mind as to what exactly happened in the film. That is all I am going to say because if you have not seen this film, then stop reading right now. If you are still reading then I am going to pose some questions to you and maybe if anyone has any answers you can email me and let me know what you think. I remember my Grade English teacher quite well. His name was Mr. Krisak. To me, he was wise beyond his years and he always had this circuitous way of teaching you things that perhaps you werent all too keen on. If we didnt like Shakespeare, then he turned the story into a modern day romance with modern day language so we could understand it. Our class room was never a room, it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book at our own leisure time. This was his own indelible way of branding something into our spongelike minds. I begin this review of Vanilla Sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave us an assignment that has been firmly etched in my mind, like the phone number of a long lost best friend, and it finally made some sense to me after watching The Matrix. Now if I didnt know better, I would have thought that the Wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher Mr. Krisak. But giving them the benefit of the doubt, well assume it wasnt him. But that was the first time this assignment was anything more than impalpable. He had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that were real. Show me how you can tell that you are real. This got the class spouting off all of the usual ideas that Im sure you can imagine. Everything from pain, to sense of touch to sense of loss to sense of hunger were spouted off to our teacher to prove to him that we were real. After every scenario that we gave him, he would come back with the one answer that would leave us speechless. What if you are nothing but someone elses dreambr What if you were someone elses dream What a messed up question that is. This was a questionscenario posed to us about years ago, before the astronomical use of the Internet and rapid advancement of computers. How possible could it seem back then But if you look at todays technology, now ask yourself, what it you were a part of someone elses dream. Another brilliant but surreal this year, David Lynchs Mulholland Drive explored similar areas. But Vanilla Sky goes deeper than any other could hope to. In short this is one that will literally if you let it blow your mind from all of the possibilities that surround you. Open your Eyes. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a young, hot shot, righteous, full of himself publisher and owner of several magazines. He inherited this from his father and although he has talent and business savvy, his board of governers, the Seven Dwarfs, think he is a rich dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth. They feel he has done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them. Early in the we meet one of Davids gorgeous toys named Julie Gianni, played with pernicious but bombastic perfection by Cameron Diaz. David and Julie play a good game, both claiming they are just there to use each other and are not the slightest bit interested in a monogamous, committed relationship. This is the type of relationship commensurate with Davids other flings hes had in the sexual prime of his life. And although both talk a good game, we can tell that only one is really telling the truth. Next we meet Brian Shelby, played with a stroke of genius by Kevin Smiths good buddy Jason Lee. Brian is writing a book that David is going to publish but they are also very good friends. This is something that David has very little of in his life and you can sense a real caring for one another early on in the film. Brian has one famous line that he keeps telling David over and over again. And that is the sweet aint so sweet without the bitter. He goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part time lover status that he seems to perpetrate with all of the floozies who inhabit his bed for a night or two. At Davids huge birthday bash, so huge that the likes of Steven Spielberg wish him a happy birthday Brian enters with his date, Sofia Sorrano, played of course by Penelope Cruz with what has to be the best performance of this year by an actress. This is a bash by invite only and at first David and Sofia seem intrigued with one another. And in typical David fashion, despite his best friend being there, he begins to flirt with Sofia. To complicate things, Julie shows up uninvited and begins spying on David. David then spends the night with Sofia, but they only talk and draw caricatures of one another. There is no hanky panky. The next day, as David is leaving Sofias apartment, he is greeted by Julie, who offers him a ride and from there.......well, I think we have all seen the commercials. That is all I will really say about the plot, because from here the teases us with what is reality and what is blurred perception. We are introduced to a character played by Kurt Russel and a few other shady characters that all play a part in this labyrinth like haze. There is a subtext of death and possible panacealike curealls that may or not be able to create the possibility of eternal life. This is just one of the intriguing possibilities the offers us, but it doesnt end there. Like many movies seem to thrive on today, this has a secret. Sixth Sense may have began this craze, but look even further back and you can maybe thank Angel Heart for starting the craze. Regardless of how it originated, Vanilla Sky has one of its own surreptitious gut busters. And what makes this one so much fun is that the gives you many obvious clues along the way but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the gauntlet of truth and lies you have just put yourself through. I have seen this four times and every time it has been because I want to see if there is something more I can pick up, something more I can understand. To be able to work your mind in the theater, to enable it to open up to new possibilities is something rare in a film. All of the ersatz so called Best Pictures of the year have been good but nothing spectacular. They lack substance. Beautiful Mind was intriguing but flat, The Royal Tenenbaums was interesting but uneven. Vanilla Sky is a rarity because it is a that leaves you yearning for more yet guarantees your satisfaction because the and those that made it care about it. I know this has received mixed reviews but I just think that those who dont like it dont quite understand it. This is what making is supposed to be like. This is what a is supposed to do to you. It is supposed to make you feel something. Most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces. This one isnt. out of The best of the year. I would love to see this get nominated for best picture and I would love to see Cruz up for best Actress, Diaz for best supporting, Cruise for best actor and Jason Mewes should be a shoe in for best supporting actor. Cameron Crowe should there as well. None of this may come to pass, and that is a shame. This is one that should not be missed. And on a final note, I am quite sure Mr. Krisak would like this and maybe this is the one that may answer his question. Can you prove you are real Or are we just a figment of someones imagination Are we artificially transplanted for someone elses bemusement This is a that spawns more questions than it does answers. And Im sure that is just fine with him. Open Your Eyes    0.324593\n"

      " Me and a friend rented this because it sounded really good. But we were wrong. First of the acting....wow...the acting was the worst, the effects were really bad as well, it seemed like a a college kid made. The plot was pretty good, but itd been done. The thing that ruined the movies the most were the actors. The main guy was the worst actor ever...its a shame Im even calling him an actor...The only good thing about this was it was so bad it was funny...so if you want a good laugh see it....but other than that...stay far away from this one. I usually love B list movies and such, but this one... I do not know how it was passed to even be put on video...this one is the worst Ive seen..and Ive seen some bad ones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0.314032\n",
      " I guess Ive seen worse films, but that may be becuz Im so jaded by how standard these bad horror movies are. The killer monster thing is really really bad, basically its a guy in some kind of green body suit. There is much worse acting as far as B go, but dont think for a second this was anything stellar, hell no. It actually did have a plot with substance, but was still pretty stupid. Basically its just a bad low budget horror movie. But at least its not as bad as titanic, that sucks balls, this one just sucks. The blood looks really fake in this movie. Thats one complaint I have about all the horror of the new millinium, low grade gore, looks stupid. good gruesome death scene with really fake blood is so stupid. At least there was a nice shower scene                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0.263743\n",
      " When I rented this I was hoping for what Reign of Fire did not deliver a clash between modern technology and mythic beasts. Instead I got a standard monster hunts stupid people in remote building flick, with bad script, bad music, bad effects, bad plot, bad acting. Bad, bad, bad. Only reason why I did give it a was that in theory there could exist worse movies. In theory.....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0.242400\n",
      " I mean, really... either i suddenly lost my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie. Its stupid, ridiculous and just not funny AT ALL. Since i saw the preview i knew it wasnt going to be a great movie, i just didnt think it was gonna be that bad... What happened to the good old times when you could find clever funny lines at any When the actors didnt have to play ridiculous roles in attempt to be funny. Now we find ourselves with movies like this one, Borat, Little Men, Scary Movie where i could not find the funny parts!!

      " Just a few words.... This really sucks. Its like those TV Movies with bad cast and plot. Its amazing how they could make this sequel worse than the III.

      " Now, Ive seen a lot of bad movies. I like bad movies. Especially bad action movies. Ive seen and enjoyed all of JeanClaude Van Dammes movies, including the one where hes his own clone, both of the ones where he plays twins, and all three where hes a cyborg. I actually own the one where he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck full of durians. Hey, if nothing else, hes got a great ass and you almost always get to see it. With DVD, you can even pause and zoom in! Thats why you can trust me when I say that this is so bad, it makes Plan look like Citizen Kane. Everything about Snake Eater is bad. The plot is bad. The script is bad. The sets are bad. The fights are bad. The stunts are bad. The FX are bad. The acting is spectacularly, earthtimebendingly bad, very probably showcasing the worst performance of every socalled actor in the cast, including Lorenzo Lamas, and thats really saying something. And Id be willing to bet everyone involved with this is lousy in bed, to boot. ESPECIALLY Lorenzo Lamas. It does manage to be unintentionally funny, so its not a total loss. However, I recommend that you watch this only if you are either a congenital idiot or very, very stoned. I was able to sit through it myself because I needed to watch something to distract me from rinsing cat urine out of my laundry. It didnt help much, but it was better than nothing.

      " This is a remake of two movies that were a lot better. The last one, Heaven Can Wait, was great, I suggest you see that one. This one is not so great. The last third of the is not so bad and Chris Rock starts to show some of the comic fun that got him to where he is today. However, I dont know what happened to the first two parts of this movie. It plays like some really bad B where people sound like they are in some bad TV sitcom. The situations are forced and it is like they are just trying to get the story over so they can start the real movie. It all seems real fake and the editing is just bad. I dont know how they could release this like that. Anyway, the last part isnt to bad, so wait for the video and see it then.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0.234696\n",
      " This is so bad, so very very bad. The acting is the biggest joke in history. Dont even bother to see it, i did ff it after min and it was just as disappointing in the end as in the beginning... I really dont understand peoples taste, Im a horror fan and Im not fastidious but I DO HAVE LIMIT! Maybe it was a quarter of a star better then the beginning of The Hoast but thats it. So I recommend you dont waste the minutes youll be able to watch. I mean the acting is better done by monkeys. And the big brother with the parental role is just awful. Dont they pay characters in Cmovies No I must say its not the first time I think a horror is bad but its absolutely one in my down ten movies and it will be charing places with Portrait of a vampire, Cabin by the lake, The Hoast!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0.226212\n",
      " It was meant to be a parody on the LOTRTrilogy. But this was one of the most awful movies Ive ever seen. Bad acting, bad screenplay, bad everything. THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINION. I dont doubt any second that there are people wholl like this sense of humor, but there have been better parodies on movies from acclaimed directors as Mel Brooks or the Zucker Brothers. Im working in a theater and in DVD Shop and the success for this was similar in both areas At the movies it was a nice but no big at all success during the first two weeks but then, when the reviews of those who have seen it were not too good, the dropped very fast. In DVD sales it was good for short time but then nobody asked for it anymore. In the last ten years, the two worst movies Ive seen are The Ring Thing and Torque. I cant decide which one was worse, but Im happy that there a so many good movies so I dont have to think too much on this question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0.225983\n",
      " I made the big mistake of actually watching this whole a few nights ago. God Im still trying to recover. This does not even deserve a . average. IMDb needs to have vote ratings possible for movies that really deserve it like this one. . is TOO HIGH. I had heard how awful this was, but I really did not think a could actually be that bad, especially in this day and era. I figured all of the cheesy god awful movies were only from the s and s. My god was I wrong. Trust me folks, this REALLY IS THAT BAD. It is beyond horrible; it is beyond pathetic; it is beyond any type of word that I can think of for it. BATTLEFIELD EARTH looks like Best Picture of the Year compared to this movie. SNAKE ISLAND which up until now was the worst Id ever seen looks like it deserves a few Oscars compared to this pathetic effort. I seriously can not believe that the makers of this thought this was a legitimate serious effort of producing a Hollywood movie. This has no business being called a movie. In the first seconds of the film, I seriously thought I was watching some high school theater class attempting to make a short movie. Or better yet, I thought it was some Saturday night Live ripoff skit of the real thing. I mean, it looks exactly like that. The acting is horrible; the whole almost looks like it was shot with a year old VHS video camera. the special effects.......well good lord Bewitched from back in the day had better special effects than this movie. The scene where he gets shot at the door is beyond laughable and beyond cheesy. I mean seriously, my Intro to Acting class from years ago in college, all of us could have put together a better than this. And the worst part of the entire movie, where Arthur is naked in the bathroom. Oh my god I almost thew up right there. I have a strong stomach, but wow that was horrible. Some people should never be naked, and hes one of them. The plot of this just seems to go absolutely nowhere. They talk about legal issues that we never hear about again; Ben talks about getting into music that we never hear about again; arthur says he is looking for a job and money for college and the next thing we see is hes running a porn shop. Everything about the is just horrible. This really doesnt have much to do with my critique, but just so everyone knows, I am not a gay man. I DO however support gay rights and believe we should all be treated as equals. And I would support any gay person in my church, unlike the cruel priest in this movie, who by the way seems to cuss every other word. WHERE IS THE F#ing white out hahaha But I didnt want anyone to think I hated this just because of it being about two gay guys. It has nothing to do with that This would have been just as horrible of a if it was Ben Jill instead of Ben Arthur. I just watched this to see if it really was as bad as they say. And yes it was even WORSE than I had read. Let this be a warning to everyone ONLY watch this if you want to just sit back and laugh at how pathetic some movies in the st century can still be. If you watch this and are actually expecting a good or some entertainment, I have no sympathy for you whatsoever. On a final thought How in the world are there movies ranked BELOW this on IMDb There is no way there are movies out there that are worse than this!    0.225913\n"

      " I thought this was hysterical. I have watched it many times and recommend it highly. Mel Brooks, was excellent. The cast was fantastic..I dont understand how this gets a out of rating. I loved it.. I have seen other movies of his and they were also funny but this one really stick out in my mind because of the humor.. His I just cant say enough about this movie. I look for it to be on periodically but it never on enough for me. The people playing the homeless people were by comparison up to the funniest standards also. Please put this on more often. I cant see it enough..Leslie Ann Warren also was another favorite of mine, ever since Cinderella. I always thought that she wasnt really funny but loved her acting. In this she was very funny..and her and Mel did a great job together. They should put more of his movies on TV.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0.239054\n",
      " I love this very much i watched it over and over. I dont see why anyone would think this wasnt good. Maybe you have seen better or whatever it is i personally love it. It is one of my favorite movies and I am not Hindi at all but i do love it. It might be a little like Pretty Woman but i havent seen that and I dont think its any better than this. I dont know why you are all trashing about it but maybe you have a good reason but I think i have said it enough but i absolutely love this movie, and to those who say its not good at all well then I wonder why you watched it and what movies you consider good. As for everyone else that i watched it with they enjoyed it too so it surprises me that this many people dont like it. As for Rani Mukherjee i think thats how you spell her last name she is very beautiful and my favorite actress ever!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0.219858\n",
      " I loved this movie! Chris Showerman did an amazing job! Not only is he an incredible actor, but he is gorgeous with an awesome physique! He did a great job on the delivery of his lines, plus transformed into George better than Fraser did. great performance for his first major roll! This is full of hilarious scenes that every child will love. My kids have watched this numerous times since we purchased the DVD the day it came out. In addition to the movie, the extras on the DVD are just as hilarious. Two thumbs up on this one! I highly recommend it to everyone!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0.214937\n",
      " Usually I dont really like Emma Roberts so much, but after watching Nancy Drew it kind of changed my mind. The actors in the movies made the whole thing exciting and funny. Most of the time when you watch a mystery you can solve it before the middle of the show, but in this its like you are actually there. The clues have to all fit together until you can finally understand the whole crime. I am still amazed how she found it out. The whole was really clever and the people who watched it with me loved the too. The clothes were my favorite part of the movie, it was so cute. I dont think there will be another like this until the sequel comes out. I give it a nine because the popular girls didnt really seem to have the part just right, but they still make me laugh. It was a really great and a great mystery. I definitely recommend watching it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0.211059\n",
      " I was too young to remmeber when I first saw this movie. But I saw it for like the second time about years ago. My sister told me I had to see it. Now my whole family has it memorized. We quote it at least once a day. I absolutly love this movie.I still laugh after all this time. Sure, its about a really, really drunk millionare that is irresponsible. The whole point is that he still has the humanity lost in the others that we see in the movie. And that he is willing to give it all up for love. I highly recomend this to anyone who wants a laugh. lot of laughs. Its hallarious, sweet, and if your a buff, it will truely change your idea of Funny. Watch it with a group of your friends or your family and I promise, you will never have nothing to talk about ever again with some Authur lines in your head. It will make you laugh for years to come. It is really hard, in my family, to find a that everyone likes. But this movie, I feel, made us closer. And I know it will do the same for you!!                                                                                                                                                         0.194684\n",
      " This was a great movie! Even though there was only about people including myself there it was great! My friend and I laughed a lot. My mom even enjoyed it. There was two middle aged women there and a mid year old there and they seemed to enjoy it. I love the part where Corky and Ned are like both liking Nancy and stuff its cute lol. And when she gets her roadster and Ned is there. Yeah This was a great even thought people underestimated it lol. Go See it i bet youll enjoy it!! I really enjoyed it and so did my friend. People were so tough on this and they hadnt even seen it. I bet next time they will give the and actresses a chance. They all did a great job in my opinion. But if you have young kids its still appropriate. I will probably take my year old niece to watch it too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0.191830\n",
      " The Night Listener is probably not one of Williams best roles, but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie. I can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of before. Some people maybe wont like the slow pacing of this movie, but I think its the great plus of the movie. It is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year . It has a intriguing performance in a with a great content, dramatic feeling. This is no americanized movie. Neither is it a predictable movie. You just feel that it is a that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be. This is no excellent that has everything, but hell, its a damn good and very original movie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0.187203\n",
      " This has always been my favorit Disney movie. Then on I saw the th aniversy of this DVD. WOW I remembered why I loved this movie. The DVD is So great, It has an extra min that the original did not have. I did not know this when I first started watching. The made ever so much more since. The music they cut out should have been left in. You have not seen this until you have seen the Full min version. lot of people say that the music is forgettable. I remember every song in this by heart, every song has its own Charm by its self, and comes together as a hole. I remember when i was younger I had the Eglantine song stuck in my head for days at a time. As well as Briny Sea that song was meant for marry poppens but was cut out of the Please Watch the new uncut th aniversy and revote for this movie. the that it really is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0.180265\n",
      " May Contain Spoilersbr All Dogs Go to Heaven is a great movie. I saw it in when I was two years old. I didnt understand it that well but as I saw it more and more times I started to love it. I love the songs in this movie. My favorite songs are Let Me Be Surprised and Soon Youll Come Home. Those are beautiful songs. The only thing that bothers me about the is Charlie dieing. When I was little my sister couldnt even watch that part. Other than that this is wonderful. My favorite part of the is when Annabelle and Charlie are flying around heaven. Heaven is beautiful in the and the clocks are very clever. I also love Itchy, in fact I have dachshunds of my own. They are so cute. Overall I love this and suggest everyone should see it. I give this stars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       0.178573\n",
      " this independent was one of the best films at the tall grass festival that i have ever seen there i loved it there are so many things that was great about the on top of all that the cast and crew that i had the opportunity to meet were absolutely phenomenal.I thought that Avi did a great job in his role. and Ricky Ullman was absolutely true to his role for a Disney actor i was amazed at his talent to be able to go from cheesy teen comedy to such an adult role with no problems the talent in the was just amazing the cinematography was just great if you want to see an independent this is one really that you should see.I think that Mr Gruver would have been so proud to have such a submission in his festival and his parents loved the so much when it won the audience favorite they went and saw it again. this truly was a great it was dark and funny and sad and truly emotional it was just fabulous. I am honestly just so enthused by this and i really dont want to spoil it for any one just see it and truly be amazed at it i think that these makers really have what it takes to go places and I hope to see more work from them in the future.    0.171746\n"

      " This is one of the best movies Ive ever seen. It has very good acting by Hanks, Newman, and everyone else. Definitely Jude Laws best performance. The cinematography is excellent, the editing is about as good, and includes a great original score that really fits in with the mood of the movie. The production design is also a factor in what makes this special. To me, it takes a lot to beat Godfather, but the fantastic cinematography displayed wins this contest. Definitely a Best Picture nominee in my book.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0.235745\n",
      " Another Excellent Arnold movie. This futuristic has great action in it, and is one of Arnies best movies. Arnold is framed as a bad guy in this and plays a Game of Death. This is excellent and a great SciFi action movie. Ive always liked this and it has to be one of the greatest adventure movies of all time. out of !

      " I just read the plot summary and it is the worst one I have ever read. It does not do justice to this incredible movie. For an example of a good summary, read the listing at Turner Classic Movies. Anyway, this was one of my favorite movies as a young child. My sister and I couldnt wait until every April when we could see it on T.V. It is one of the best horse movies of its time. It is one of those great classics that the whole family can watch. The romance is clean and endearing. The story line is interesting and the songs are great. They dont make movies like this anymore. Good acting and not over the top. Pat Boone and Shirley Jones are at their best, along with many other great character actors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0.205167\n",
      " The Night Listener is probably not one of Williams best roles, but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie. I can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of before. Some people maybe wont like the slow pacing of this movie, but I think its the great plus of the movie. It is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year . It has a intriguing performance in a with a great content, dramatic feeling. This is no americanized movie. Neither is it a predictable movie. You just feel that it is a that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be. This is no excellent that has everything, but hell, its a damn good and very original movie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0.202101\n",

      " Not many reviews, hence thought i would add one. DO NOT GO BY THE OTHER REVIEWS! This was a excellent movie. RKS is one of the very few Indian directors that can actually put together a really good movie. AB and Akshay given yet another example of great acting, as does bhoomika too, which was a little unexpected, but great to watch. Am surprised there has not been much hype around release. Or filmfareother awards nominations, considering how good the was. Better then Khakee i thought and i thought Khakkee too was good movie. Is a fairly long movie, but definitely worth it and while watching it, definitely does seem long. Cant wait for RKS next and the next AB, Akshay they always seem to do well together... e.g. waqt. Bhoomika too has acted really well in the and should do really well if she continue in the same fashion in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0.174056\n",
      " I just accidentally stumbled over this on TV one day. It was aired in the middle of the day on a channel not exactly famous for airing good movies. This one, however, was nothing less then good. October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam, a boy inspired by the Sputnick launch to become a rocket scientist. He and his friends begin to build rockets. His father is not to happy about his sons new found hobby and would rather see him become a coalminer as himself or go to college on a footballscholarship like his brother. The story is well written. bit too predictable maybe, but thats OK cause it doesnt focus too much on those parts of the story. Its important part, but where this is obvious the inner action, the action between the characters is focused on. The story is good. It has some clichés, but thats OK. Its based on actual events so you kind of cant just drop out these clichés. The characters are really good. Where the story is on a downhill the characters are brought out and manage to keep the action and the quality of the high. You get to know these characters and you get sympathy for them. They are well written and believable. This is a good looking movie. The sets and the s style is thorough and the pictures are well composed and well lit. This all sets the mood of the very good. The acting is really good. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a great performance as Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper is good as John Hickam. As for the rest of the cast they are good too. All together this makes out a pretty strong cast. All in all Im glad I caught this movie. It was first after seeing it I learned that it was based on actual events. If I had known that when seeing it, it would probably just be even more interesting. October Sky is a good and interesting movie. Its a I believe everyone can enjoy. Its kind of a feelgood movie. Not bad at all!    0.171980\n"

      " What i like about you is one of those series you need to see but arent sure you would see, the beginning is cool and its sucks you into the series just for fun, the second part i season which are more stale, they come and go in what you want. what happens with many series is that they dont end with something special because the second part of the series always goes down into the drain, this one also somewhat did, the third part is the one to spoil and ruin the whole series, usually, but it doesnt, this ending is perfect for the series, it fits perfect, actually i was pretty angry about all these guys in Vals life, actually i wanted to end with Jeff in the end, but later on it changed, they chose to take Vic into the series after almost seasons without him, and that was the biggest surprise and also what made the series go on top. see it many times the series is actually very cool just dont expect the second part to be that good it isnt but the third part does what was needed and made the series to one that was worth the whole thing, i am happy to say i was glad and happy about the series and now i will go over to see two guys a girl and a pizza place, when i have seen the whole series i will be back...

However, the stunning series finale answers just over half of those questions, despite its anticlimatic ending.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0.446966\n",
      " On Sunday July , , the first episode of a new science fiction series called Stargate SG was broadcast on Showtime. spinoff of and sequel to the Stargate starring Kurt Russell and James Spader, the series begins approximately one year after the events portrayed in the film. For ten seasons, it chronicled the adventures and misadventures of an intrepid team of explorers known as SG. Originally, the series starred Richard Dean Anderson as Colonel Jack ONeill two ls!, Michael Shanks as Dr. Daniel Jackson, Amanda Tapping as Captain Samantha Carter, Christopher Judge as Tealc and Don S. Davis as Major General George S. Hammond. For ten long years, we watched the team battle against the Goauld, the Replicators, the Ori and many other aggressors. At the same time, they forged alliances with the Asgard, the Tokra, the rebel Jaffa, the Nox and the Tollan. They saved the world no less than eight times over the years and never gave up, not until death claimed them. And sometimes not even then. As with all longrunning series, they were numerous cast changes. Michael Shanks left the series in January at the end of its fifth season in order to broaden his horizons as an actor. Daniel Jacksons successor as the teams resident archaeologistgeek was Jonas Quinn, an alien from a country called Kelowna on the planet Langara, played by Corin Nemec. However, Shanks returned at the beginning of the seventh season in June and Nemec left at the same time. Unfortunately, he made only one further guest appearance and his character was seldom mentioned afterwards. Don S. Davis left the series at the end of the seventh season in March as he felt that it was time for him to go. The shows original star and arguably its most popular actor, Richard Dean Anderson, starred in the series throughout its first eight seasons. His participation in the seventh and eight seasons was noticeably less than in the earlier seasons. He finally left SG in March in order to spend more time with his then sixyearold daughter. Jack ONeill was by far my favourite character in the series and, truth be told, I never enjoyed the last two seasons as much as I did the earlier episodes for that very reason. The ninth season represented a new era for the programme. With the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the Goauld and the Replicators in Season Eight, many fans felt the series should go out on a high. Regardless, the series carried on for a further two years with the Ori replacing the Goauld as the series main adversaries. Three new characters were brought in to fill the gaps as it were and help usher in this reinvention. Ben Browder came in as the cocky Southern Air Force pilot Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell, the new leader of SG. His Farscape costar, the lovely Claudia Black, began to play a prominent role in the series as the vivacious, sexy, hilarious and certainly extroverted Vala Mal Doran, a former Goauld host and con artist from another planet. recurring guest star during the eighth and ninth seasons, she joined the cast full time at the beginning of its tenth and final season. Rounding off the cast was the legendary Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry, the new commander of the SGC and an old friend of Jack ONeill and General Hammond. For the last two years, they starred alongside the SG faithful Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge and became valuable parts of and made equally valuable contributions to the Stargate franchise. Alas, all good things must come to an end. During the initial broadcast of the first several episodes of Season Ten, ratings dropped considerably, resulting in cancellation in its August . After ten seasons and episodes, the dream was finally over. On March , , what began with Children of the Gods ended with Unending. The series finale made its world premiere on Sky One in Britain and Ireland before being shown on the SciFi Channel in the United States on June , . In the ten years that the series was on the air, it amassed legions of fans and even eclipsed the science fiction series, Star Trek, in terms of popularity in certain countries. It became the secondlongest running scifi series in the world, second only to Doctor Who , and the longestrunning American produced scifi series, having surpassed The XFiles only a few months before it ended. Stargate SG represents the cornerstone of the Stargate franchise. In , its success and popularity led to the production of a spinoff series entitled Stargate Atlantis, which was regrettably cancelled after five seasons and episodes in August . Although plans for another feature fell through, two directtoDVD films, Stargate The Ark of Truth and Stargate Continuum, were released in and more are planned for the not too distant future. third liveaction series, Stargate Universe, is also due to premiere at some point next year. There was, unfortunately, an animated series, Stargate Infinity, which ran only from to but the less said about that the better. Despite the end of SG and Atlantis as continuing series, the future of Stargate looks very bright indeed. In conclusion, while Stargate has yet to gain the same degree of popular recognition as other major scifi television franchises such as Star Trek and Doctor Who, its still relatively new compared to those two scifi giants and I have every confidence that it will continue for many, many years to come.    0.395048\n",
      " super comedy series from the s Two series were made in total that suffered in the UK ratings due to poor scheduling. When you are up against established comedies like Minder, even the best new comedies are going to struggle to get noticed. Luckily, I caught the series from episode one and followed it avidly. I mentioned it to friends and family at the time, but everyone seemed to have been watching something else. Very, very frustrating. Anyway, I loved both series and never forgot it. Then I looked it up on the internet and found that an ultrafan was trying to get both series released on his own. Well, both series are now available on DVD. httpwww.replaydvd.co.ukjoking_apart_S.htm                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0.376008\n",
      " Bonanza had a great cast of wonderful actors. Lorne Greene, Pernell Whitaker, Michael Landon, Dan Blocker, and even Guy Williams as the cousin who was brought in for several episodes during to replace Adam when he was leaving the series. The cast had chemistry, and they seemed to genuinely like each other. That made many of their weakest stories work a lot better than they should have. It also made many of their best stories into great western drama. Like any show that was shooting over thirty episodes every season, there are bound to be some weak ones. However, most of the time each episode had an interesting story, some kind of conflict, and a resolution that usually did not include violence. While Bonanza was a western, the gunfighting was never featured as the main attraction. While I am a fan of The Rifleman and Wanted Dead Or Alive; those shows usually ended with a gunfight. Gunfights were how many westerns resolved every conflict, and Bonanza was very different in trying to seek peaceful resolutions and harmony instead of killing. In the early years of Bonanza, there are some interesting episodes that do feature a lot of gunfights. Those episodes stand in contrast to the rest of the series, but they are pretty good in and of themselves. In , when Pernell Whitaker wanted to leave the show, Guy Williams was brought in to replace him. Williams was playing the role of a longlost cousin. Unfortunately, Whitaker decided to stay one more year, and thus Williams was written out of the series when he moved away to marry Adams old girlfriend. If Williams had stayed on for the duration of Bonanza, one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after , when Pernell Whitaker left the show. Undoubtedly, once Pernell Whitaker left the series, the stories focused more on comedy and country hijinks. Whitaker had often played the heavy in many episodes, and his absence left a void in the cast. Little Joe always wanted to play the nice kid, and Hoss always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold. Since Ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family, that did not leave too much room for any gunfights. At some point they hired a ranch hand called Candy David Canary who became their fourth member of the cast, but Candy was never featured in any gunfights, and he was hardly more than an older version of Little Joe. For a year or two they also had Ben take in some other lost cousin Jamie, played by the forgettable Mitch Vogel who was a teenager that was usually getting into some kind of trouble with someone. Apparently by adding the teenager, the studio was looking to attract younger viewers. It also gave the writers a chance to write episodes about teenage problems, alcohol, delinquency, etc. Those kind of preachy episodes were popular in the s as a reaction of the establishment media to the counterculture movement. Dragnet was probably the most popular source of law and order TV, though Hawaii , The F.B.I. and many other shows also tried to jump on the bandwagon by doing TV shows that featured irresponsible teenagers causing mischief, mayhem, and crime. The addition of a teenager to the cast gave the Cartwrights more chances to show up and solve problems, but those episodes feel very contrived and are not very good in general. After Dan Blocker died, the series limped along for another year or so before it was canceled. The last season was pretty bad, as it featured Little Joe tracking down the killers of his wife, and most of the episodes were somewhat depressing because Little Joe was usually drinking or otherwise remembering how much he loved his wife, and how unfair it was that she was killed. I dont think I have ever seen the last episode of the series, and I wonder if they ever officially wrapped it up in some way. By the last year, there was only Ben Lorne Greene actually living on the Ponderosa, as Adam had moved away and never came back even once as a guest and Hoss had died and Little Joe had left after his wife in the series had been killed by drifters. Overall, the era from is the best of this series. Once Adam left, it slowly declined. Most of the shows before are pretty good too. By , the series was trying to hard to be hip and topical, and it had lost a lot of its western flavor. The addition of Candy and the teenage kid also diluted the general quality of the show, and the death of Hoss Dan Blocker was the final nail. Bonanza is probably the best western series ever made, and of the episodes that were produced, at least one hundred of them are excellent western drama! That is a pretty good record. Even the worst of Bonanza is better than a lot of other TV shows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0.309949\n",
      " No spoilers here but I have been a fan since Waking the Dead started but the last series, of which only have been on so far is awful. The stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series. I found these in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous. As a BBC licence payer, after the show I rang BBC complaints to pass on my disappointment. Im amazed that actors of the calibre of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone didnt object to the story lines. These actors have been with these characters for seasons, surly they can see its lost all direction. Its a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of Father Christmas!

      " The st season was amazing, the whole idea of them adjusting to the island, while mysteries were being explored And seen was just phenomenal; filled with suspense, tons of cliffhangers, and an amazing plot. I mean, I love the whole idea of just seeing them get used to the island. And then first seeing the smoke monster in the first episode really caught my attention. From then on, I was hooked The second season was right on par with the st season, only a little better. I absolutely loved the idea of the hatches and the DHARMA Initiative. The whole plot and sequences of season were mysterious, creepy, and exciting. I loved all the suspense surround others on the island, but the DHARMA story really made season amazing. Season wasnt quite as good as and ... but nonetheless, great. I loved seeing the backstories of the others, seeing their camp, and seeing the mysteries further explored. Tricia Tanak Is Dead is one of my favorite episodes. This season, while not as good, was still breathtaking and fun, but most of all exciting! Now, the th season. I had hopes for this season, and the st couple of episodes were good, but then it REALLY started to get boring and monotonous. I mean, I REALLY despise the new rescuers such as Miles and Daniel. The plot got old after the first couple episodes ... and MOST OF ALL .... Season was stripped away of something which made LOST a perfect series The mystery, suspense, comedy mixed in Charlie gone and overall excitement. Also, some of my favorite characters have left.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0.298450\n",
      " I would have rated the series a perfect for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of Season ! The final episode of the th season Unending, where it would certainly appear that the Asgard have been killedoff in a very rushed, unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion, left me in disbelief! From the extremely rushed end of the series, its obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season. My guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the Stargate SG franchise for the two upcoming directtoDVD moves! Unless the Asgard return in a future SG with a very good explanation of the apparent extinction, I think that the fans have been cheated with a poor cleanup of looseends! Poor end to an otherwise brilliant scifi series.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0.292764\n",
      " It took us a couple of episodes to get into Dark Angel as a story and a series, since we were transitioning from The Sopranos, a very different mentality framework. But, once we got with the gist of the series, we were very quickly hooked. Its a shame that the series ended just when it was just starting to past good into the excellent category Dark Angelwas much more than your average TV series. It kicks ass and rocks as far as action goes, but the interactions of the characters and societal reactions to mutants reminds us of the constant prejudices that we face and make everyday. That the story is set in the future keeps the mood surreal and prevents the antidiscrimination message from being rubbed in our faces hence not ruining the fun for those who dont like to be lectured during entertainment, but every event and humansocietal interaction remains relevant to the present. We all make judgments, face our own prejudices, but, in the end, the question of who you are lies in do you sit back and shut your mind to it, or do you get up and do something about it For those who have no choice but to fight, for survival or justice, this series empowers them. For those whove never had to face the question, this series sneaks in that message under the guise of pure action entertainment. It is much more wellmade and wellwritten than most TV series; Im highly disappointed it ended before it could really kick into high gear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0.285936\n",
      " When I first heard about this series on AnimeTV,I have to say that out of all the shows that I have seen,this one tops it all off. I had to see this show,and that is what I really did. When I got the first volume of this show,it was the best. I really liked the animation,and all the fight scenes were awesome. I have to say that my favorite characters in the show were Saber,and Archer and of course I also like Illya. And of course,all the episodes on the volumes were interesting,and very cool. Another thing I have to say about the series is Michael McConnohiefamous for Transformers,and others playing the voice of Berserker. He does have a cool character. And I even watched the entire series all over again before watching the final volume. So if you to see something good,then see this show,its the best.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0.279346\n"

      "0  You can survive Surviving Christmas. I thought the television version was a bit edited way down. I like Ben Afleck. He plays Drew Johnson, a familyless adult, who is willing to pay complete strangers. The Valcos starring James Gandolfini and Catherine OHara as the parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco, the daughter. Drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesnt have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the Chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars. Bill Macy who I best remember for playing Maudes husband Arthur is hired to play Duda, the grandfather. When the whole situation comes crashing down, the truth can be painful. The Valcos household is crumbling apart from the Drew situation. Drews rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit. You cant buy what you wish for! The acting and writing is mediocre but the first rate cast pulls it through to the final scene.\n",
      "1  Someones at the Door. OHHH, How I miss this show so bad.. but we are lucky to now have Invasion. Thank You, Shawn Cassidy. American Gothic, had it all.If I had to pick one thing that I liked best about the show, it has to be its not predictable plotlines. Favorite actor was Lucas Black.. I adore that southern accent. I bought the DVD asap, and my kids are fans too. There is some hot n steamy scenes. Some Devilish ones too. So, if kiddos will be watching you may want to editfastforwardskip. It has humour, on a Joss Wheedon level, which so many shows lack. Adult wit and adult situation, that are handled with finese. The DVD has some extras, but I wish it has many more. If you want to get thrilled and enjoy a great show, come watch American Gothic!\n",
      "2  I saw Shiner on DVD. While I was watching it, I thought, This is a really bad porn flick without the porn. I also thought, Whoever wrote this has some real issues. Then I watched the directorwriter Carlson explain his process as a special feature. Yeah, it was real special. The emphasis of the is placed on two alcoholic losers who hit each other to get off. They are marginally attractive. There is frontal and full nudity. These factors probably account for the being seen at all. The most upsetting element of the is the gay bashing and the subsequent further gay bashing of the same victim who tries ineptly to exact revenge from his assailants, the two drunken losers. Not only is the subject handled absurdly and badly from a technical point of view, but the acting is horrendously bad. Then theres the boxerstalker theme. This is really insane, not just absurd. This hunky boxer is somehow traumatized by the persistent attentions of a fleshy mommas boy who works at his gyms parking lot. This is in LA, mind you. The boxer is so traumatized that he turns up at the stalkers house, strips in front of him and gets excited in the process. Well, all I can say is, why would a boxer who is at heart an exhibitionist be so traumatized by the attention of a stalker It simply makes no sense. And, Im afraid, some psychodynamics actually do make sense, if you take the time to read about them. However, bad scripts seldom make sense at all. The directorwriter seems to have thought that this represents a considerable minority within the gay community. Well, he may be correct, I suppose. We may never know, since that minority would be so dysfunctional they would hardly be able to get organized enough to ever get to an obscure gay festival or DVD store, the only two places they could possibly find this turkey. Thank goodness for that.\n",
      "3  This Mans Navy is, as other comments have indicated, a rare and wellfilmed look at Navy lighter than air LTA activities. The LTA crews were justly proud that the convoys they shadowed never lost a ship to submarine attack. And the filming at the various NAS locations give a valuable glimpse at a type of aviation that is long gone. However, the first half of the is all about Beery, his relationship with his service pals, and him meeting the Tom Drake character and his mother, and getting Drakes leg fixed. Only then does the second start. The second is mostly LTAs in action, taking on a surfaced sub, guys get killed and much damage is caused. The look is fairly gritty and realistic, I imagine. Then we shift to Southeast Asia. Did the Navy have LTAs there Never mind, this part is really wild, with a blimp being used to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle. And the Japs are shooting like mad. Shades of Vietnam, except the getaway is oh, so leisurely. This is a blimp were talking about. In the end, a feelgood WWII drama about a very unusual part of the war.\n",
      "4  This is mostly chase scenes and special effects. It is very weak on plot. Most of the computer talk was just mumbojumbo. I watched this because I was a big fan of the original War Games which was based mostly on computer fact and real computer terminology. This had none of that. Most of the computer scenes were not only impossible and highly unrealistic of real computers and networks, but just lame. It is like it was written by somebody who has no comprehension of real computers. The ripley game was lame and was essentially just an arcade game. No real hacking, so what was the point Movie was boring. Lame sequel.\n",
      "5  Though this has a first rate roster of fine actors, special effects that are excellent, and a story line that is full of surprises, it wasnt picked up for studio distribution and went directly to DVD. Perhaps it contains too much antipolice force information, or perhaps it is juts one too many action flicks released during a glut, but whatever the reason the big screens missed the opportunity, fortunately the new concept of releasing direct to DVD allows us to enjoy it. The theme is old rookie reporter uncovers an inner circle of cops that are corrupt in this case the F.R..T. First Response Assault and Tactical team, a group of well trained policeman created to clean up the mythical city of Edison from its low point of crime, drugs, prostitution etc. Working undercover the temptation of pocketing the confiscated goods and money proves too much of an opportunity and now, years after its formation, FRAT is responsible for murder, drug trafficking, terrorizing innocent people etc. The lead dog is Lazerov Dylan McDermott, who makes a terrifyingly real gangster! and his partner Rafe Deed LL Cool J, even more buff than usual and proving he can be a sensitive actor. Reporter Pollack Justin Timberlake catches wind of a bad mistake and reports his theory of fraud and corruption to his papers boss Ashford the always reliably fine Morgan Freeman. Gradually Polack convinces Ashford and subsequently Wallace Kevin Spacey, also a consistently fine character actor and they aid Pollack in this investigative reporting. The closer Pollack gets to the truth the more surprises and bad incidents happen and the story runs pall mall toward a series of unexpected results. Timberlake lacks the charisma to carry the lead, especially in the company of such seasoned actors. But LL Cool J, Freeman, Spacey, and McDermott keep the welloiled machine of a rolling to the very end. No, it is not a great movie, but it is one that makes for an edge of the seat action flick with a message. Grady Harp\n",
      "6  Arthur Bach is decidedly unhappy in his life as a multimillionaire and is attracted to people below him in social standing he pays for a hooker in the opening scenes and then is enormously attracted to a shoplifter. He drinks quite a lot too, and sometimes he is driving while drinking, too, which of course is not funny, ever. The is great but behind the comedy is some reality, too. John Gielgud wipes the floor with everyone else on screen and created a character for the ages. Talk about deserving an Oscar. Moore and Minnelli have their moments, but its Gielgud as Hobson youll remember the most.\n"

      "7  I watched part one two days ago and today I saw part two. Of course the two parts are worlds apart so I am a little shaken by all that I just saw. I felt consumed by the knowledge of the inevitability of Ches death; for me, it clouded the entire movie. I suppose that is exactly what Soderbergh wanted us to feel, the slowly evolving inevitability of his death. Part Two was so downbeat compared to, again an inevitability but in Cuba it was positive and in Bolivia it was so negative. The politics of the movement in Bolivia were only alluded to but rarely confronted didactically. For me the memorable scenes were all at the end of the the confrontation with the jailer and the milder talk with the Bolivian official where that official questions Che about the failure of the peasants to support his revolution. I had not considered the national differences playing as much role as they did in the conflict, Argentine versus Bolivian. I thought Soderbergh dealt admirably with the inevitable problems of supply in a revolutionary struggle; how do you get food without antagonizing the peasants who do not have enough themselves. I was struck by how hard it would be to try something as Che tried. I guess it is all in the timing; is there sufficient anger against the government to begin the movement; in Bolivia there wasnt. Che realized the terrible corundum of revolutionists in his letter to Fidel read at the beginning of the If not now, when, years from now. very thought provoking and well done film; make every effort to see it.\n",
      "8  Where to start. The started out pretty well, but after the min mark i caught myself watching the clock. The horror at the start of the was good but then the story kicked in. It just got stupider and stupider as time ticked by. The actors gave an average performance in this however, i got a bit bored of Vinny Jones constant scowling in the film. As the dragged on, and take my word for it, it dragged on, it just got more and more far fetched. SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT Just when i thought the could not get any worse, towards the end loads if skeleton looking monsters turned up, just to eat the dead people which made no sense at all. It turned out to be some sort of flesh eating cult and the good guys die at the end. The ending in fact just made me laugh at how bad it was. Once the lead role disposes of Vinny Jones, he becomes the new killer. In closing, this made Creep look like the best horror ever made. I gave it star because the female lead did a pretty good job but even she could not save this train wreck of a movie!!\n",
      "9  What did I just watch I spent minutes of my precious life watching one of the dumbest movies Ive ever seen. The concept of a serial killer clown is actually quite scary seeing is there are a lot of people who are afraid of clowns....but having it be a pound nursery rhyme reciting killer clown makes a mockery of the genre. I still am wondering how the character Mark wasnt able to run away from the Clown...hes pounds, hes gotta get tired eventually. The whole ending made me get up and literally say aloud What did I just watch Apparently Brandon is Denises cousin.... and they had got it on near the middle of the meaning he had sex with his cousin.....yeah thats something people want so see shudders. Another thing I found hilariously stupid was the opening scene where the clown stabs a woman and she says What did you do Well bytch, what do you think he just did The last thing that was stupidly funny was one second the main character was slapping the hitchhiker and calling her a cnt and then minutes later saying violence isnt helping anything....did the writer of the script give the line to the wrong guy None of this makes sense anyway. The was more or less a dumb low budget porno which I got sucked into buying all .and got no entertainment out of it besides the sex scenes. Im surprised the fat clown didnt join the orgy, would have fit right in. I hoped the would have some entertainment value like other B movies might have, but I was wrong. This is a moronic piece of garbage thats not even worth watching. out of\n",
      "10  The only good thing about People I Know is that it serves as a perfect example of movies that Al Pacino should avoid performing in. The first big turnoff I had was the way in which Pacino tried to portray a Georgia accent; at times it was weak and unattractive while in other segments it seemed too overdone. Dialogue and character interaction was terrible along with a weak plot. The supporting cast did an extremely perfunctory job in keeping the interesting, and within an hour I still saw no signs of a sturdy plot. The story overall is a real bore, and I had to slap myself in the face a few times to keep myself awake. This will surely bore you as well...avoid at all costs.\n",
      "11  Where to start ! . . . I feel ... violated! Thats right, violated! I just spent .hrs of my life, .hrs that I could have spent doing something more useful, like watching paint dry, on this so called horror flick. Its not scary, its not funny, its not dramatic, its no action, its nothing... Its predictable, its boring, its tragic... I might come of a bit harsh here, but watch this and you will feel the same way ... or ... no, dont watch it...unless you want to feel violated also.\n",
      "12  I was excited to discover this late sixties comedy staring some of my favorite people Maggie Smith, a very young Bob Newhart and, of course, Peter Ustinov. My disappointment was thus compounded to discover the doesnt work as either a comedy or a perfect heist film. Ustinov plays a small time crook just out of prison who sets his sites on a large American corporation based in London. Bluffing his way past dimwitted CEO Karl Malden and tech geek Newhart, Ustinov passes himself off as a computer expert and immediately plans the perfect heist part of the film. To do this he needs to get passed a tamper proof security system that guards the corporation mainframe. And here is problem one. His perfect plan only works because everyone else in the is remarkably trusting and stupid. His lame excuses are taken at face value and this must be the only computer center anywhere not to bother with video cameras. The second problem is the heist fraud really happens within the first minutes of the robbing the rest of the picture of much in way of dramatic tension. Maggie Smith is sadly miscast as Ustinovs ditsy next door neighborsecretary who just cant keep a job. I love Maggie Smith but she just seems too together here, too composed, the part called for more of a wacky, physical comedian. Furthermore, Ustinov and Smith have no chemistry together, maybe its the age difference, but the later romantic relationship, as devoid of actual romance as it is, still comes off a little creepy. Ustinov cowrote the script, and it was thought well of at the time, but I found it unfunny, meandering and a sad waste of a great cast.\n"

      "13  In theory, films should be a form of entertainment. While this excludes documentaries and other experimental forms of filmmaking; most movies, specially genre films, must not only tell its story or message, they must entertain their target audience in some way. All this just to say that in my opinion a bad is not a with low production values or lowbudget, a bad is one that is boring. Hellborn or Asylum of the Damned as is known in the U.S., is a bad simply because it is just not involving, and irremediably boring and tiresome. While it has a very good premise, it is just poorly developed and the mediocre acting doesnt make things better. On another hands the probably could had been a fine or even classic Bmovie, but here it is just a bad attempt at filmmaking. Director Philip J. Jones tells the tale of James Bishop Matt Stasi, a young psychiatry resident, who just got his dream job at St. Andrew Mental Hospital; but the old asylum seems to hide a secret. After the mysterious death of some patients and the constant rumors of satanic practices, James decides to find out what is going on; only to find the incredulity of his boss, Dr. McCort Bruce Payne, who believes that Bishop is going as insane as his patients. While the premise is quite interesting, the execution of the leaves a lot to be desired. In an attempt of making a supernatural psychological thriller, Jones goes for the easy way out and makes a filled with every cliché of the genre. Of course, there are lots of great movies that are also filled with clichés; but in Hellborn every single one is wasted and turned into a cheap jump scare to keep things moving, resulting in a boring and predictable storyline. The acting is quite mediocre for the most part, with one big exception Bruce Payne gives a topnotch performance that makes the look unworthy of such good acting. Matt Stasi is very weak as the lead character and the rest of the cast make forgettable performances. Despite all this flaws, one thing has to be written about Hellborn; it has a visual look very good for the budget and very similar to modern day bigbudget Hollywod horror productions. Also, the makeup and prosthetics are done very nicely and the designs for the main antagonist are quite good. Sadly, the rest of the Special Effects are awful and outdated, making a huge contrast with the makeup prosthetics. Hellborn is a with a few good things outnumbered by its serious flaws with terrible results. Hardcore horror or bmovie fans may be interested by its premise but it is a boring and tiresome experience.\n",
      "14  Sublimity is the way we have to reach for The Beauty. And sublimity is the stuff this is made of. If not his best, its my most loved of all Bogdanovich movies. This unique masterpiece remind us, as most of the other films from the director, what life is or should be about love, lost or failure and hope and faith and charity. As the song from whom the films takes its title Gershwins well known composition the makes the impossible true, and tries to make us aware that noone is able to judge anybody; all this with the lightness of a comedy and the timing of a masterful direction the first ten minutes, with the detectives following the ladies, almost without a line of dialogue, constructed upon the looks and views of the characters with that Bogdanovich touch based on the pointofview is a class on Cinema Language, something that P.B. learned well from his admired directors from the Golden Age of the Movies. With a superb cast and a glorious soundtrack including the best of Sinatras Trilogy, this movie, full of selfconsciousness and compassion, and far away from selfindulgence and emptiness as some critics wrote, deserves a better place on the History of American Cinema than where it have been placed. Its not long on style, short on substance it is complex in its simplicity, and beautiful, absolutely beautiful.\n",
      "15  When I first heard about this series on AnimeTV,I have to say that out of all the shows that I have seen,this one tops it all off. I had to see this show,and that is what I really did. When I got the first volume of this show,it was the best. I really liked the animation,and all the fight scenes were awesome. I have to say that my favorite characters in the show were Saber,and Archer and of course I also like Illya. And of course,all the episodes on the volumes were interesting,and very cool. Another thing I have to say about the series is Michael McConnohiefamous for Transformers,and others playing the voice of Berserker. He does have a cool character. And I even watched the entire series all over again before watching the final volume. So if you to see something good,then see this show,its the best.\n",
      "16  If you know the story of Grey Owl, youll love the movie! Annie Galipeau is a great actress, and Pierce is better than never in Grey Owl. But in this theres no real scene of action. I think this should be nominated at the Oscars! Welll go see this movie, its CLASSIC!\n",
      "17  This is a review of Freddy Mercury The Untold Story, theatrical release, Chicago Int. Film Festival, One of the phoniest, uninspired and most tedious biographical documentaries I have seen. If the I saw in a theater was originally released on TV, I would plead with its producers and distributors to not fool a paying audience with the false promise of a cinematically worthy documentary feature. Even as a madeforTV documentary, the sentimental piano solos accompanying interviewees sitting in front of flower arrangements in hotel rooms and the pompous, pseudoliterary narration rang more true of a sleepapedic bed Infomercial. The only redeeming aspects of this The Untold Story of Freddy Mercury or, uhm, was it The Untold Story of Princess Diana are the original concert, video and TV footage unabridged Freddy Mercury and Queen. Testimonial interviews with irrelevant eye witnesses with insights, such as He was a free spirit, really.. I thought Freddy Mercury was a company man... belittle those Freddy testimonials, by Brian May or Montserrat Caballe that shed new and affectionate light into Mercurys complex life and character. And... what up with the Harry Potterlike boarding school segments How did the interview with the first girlcrush ...who now works in a travel agency and members of Freddys first school band contribute to what I really want to know about Mercury Vital milestones of his personal life, his sexuality, his artistic style and growth, Queen, the band remain unexplored. These filmmakers dont ask a single, provocative question, nor do they engage in independent or visionary research of their subject, instead delivering a tedious montage of politely clean and vastly empty comments about an enigmatic and brilliant rock legend, who doesnt deserve to be remembered by this History Channel biography your grandparents can doze off to on a Sunday night.\n"

      "18  I cant understand at all why so many Godzilla fans think this is excellent, one of the best Godzilla films ever in fact. This is horrible and one of the very few Gojira films I cant stand to watch again the other being G. vs Megalon. The plot is too campy to be in the Heisei series, a series that attempted to turn the aging Godzilla franchise into bonafide action films, revolving around ideas that seemed more in place in than . It just sounded ridiculous, especially with some of the subject matter, take for example the WW scene, with the Japanese soldiers praising a dying Godzillasaurus, a mournful and serious tone, take the exuberant former commander turn capitalist and his death, serious seens in a its fans somehow denote as played for laughs, as a goofy romp with guilty illogical fun, if so than this is easily one of the most tasteless films Ive seen, however I think its more likely it was only talent the filmmakers lacked and this was a case of a straight faced action gone bad. It was made ever worse by the fact that the special effects are terrible beyond compare, from the jet packs to the android, to the hokey sound effects emitted from everything, its impossible to take anything seriously, and yet the expects you to, theres no nudges to the camera. Like nearly all Godzilla films theres a pointless romance, and this is no exception, though something can be said about the fact that this one is especially pointless since and inexplicable. There is literally no reason at all presented for the romance, it just happens and there lives make degree commitments for it. Aside from this the other terrible aspect of this is dialogue, both the Japanese and English is horrible, clunky and possibly the inspiration for Battlefield Earth. The Tristar DVD compounds the problems, making everything look grainy, blurred, dim and just plain ugly, the same was for the sound. I first saw the Japanese Region version and the differences are night and day, with the original vibrant colors and texture, the noteworthy score, the fight scenes especially, are actually watchable. In my opinion, the Heisei series is a disappointment, with the exception of Godzilla Japanese version there is little to praise here, and Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah is case in point of this failure. It doesnt even come close to deserving the reputation and fans it gets. out of\n",
