For each of these scenarios decide if you could use supervised or unsupervised techniques, or both!

Define the likelihood that an individual will contract a specific disease
    - supervised - we need to know which class belongs where as we classify them

Translate a set of images into variables for modeling
    - unsupervised - we don't need to know how the translation happens
    
    
An ecommerce company wants to identify power users
    - Both - could know ahead or define the power users after grouping them
 
That same company wants to see shopping patterns in users
    - unsupervised - finding patterns does not have an defined outcome
  
You want to reduce the number of variables inputting into your random forest model
    - Unsupervised - reduce based on variance contribution which is not predefined
