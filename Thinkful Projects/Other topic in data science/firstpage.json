Sure, I knew people judged me negatively on how I dressed, but I didn\u2019t care\u2026.my short skirts and hot pants were the under-promise that inevitably became an over-perform.", "When I was pregnant with my first child I went to a school reunion. A man I had never met before expressed pity that I would consider working after having my baby. His Lexi was all about the family. He asked what my husband did, and told me at length why it was a bad decision for me to go back to work. He never once asked me what I did.", "My pregnancy was a happy surprise \u2013 I found out I was expecting my son shortly after finishing medical school, and quite early in my relationship. My mother is from South India, and a cousin I am close to was concerned how our family would respond to our news \u2013 within our culture babies before marriage are still relatively uncommon. When I said I was expecting a boy she said \u201cyou\u2019re going to hate me for saying this, but at least it is a boy\u2026I think that will make it easier for the family to accept\u201d. I did not hate her, but I was very surprised.", "Fast forward 6 months, and it was my first day back to work. Like most new parents I was apprehensive about leaving my baby, but I felt ready, and pleased to start being a doctor again. Day 1 the questions started: \u201cHow can you bring yourself to leave your baby?\u201d \u201cWow, your night shifts and weekends must put a lot of pressure on your husband\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you pick family practice?\u201d. The dads I work with just don\u2019t get this!", "Baby number 2 arrived 7 years ago \u2013 this time a girl. From the moment I brought her home people treated her differently. As a rule people comment on what she looks like and what he does. Evidently big blue eyes are much more impressive on a girl. Her looks have become no less interesting since she has been old enough for her personality to eclipse them. She talked about a year earlier than her brother, and can beat anyone in the family at memory games, yet people ask \u201cdo you think your son will go into medicine?\u201d\u2026.\u201dis he good at maths like his Dad?\u201d\u2026even his likely future voting preferences have been commented on\u2026..my daughter, however, is \u201cgoing to be a heart breaker\u201d. ", "Other aspects of sexism within our society are now increasingly obvious to me. It no longer seems funny or trivial that our sing about the men on the bus \u201cread read reading\u201d whilst the women \u201cchatter chatter chatter\u201d. Nor is it amusing to be asked for the umpteenth time \u201cWhat did you used to do?\u201d Nowadays many of my friends also have children. Of all the mothers I know, only one other is the main bread winner in her family (this was not the case pre children when the women tended to be the high flyers!). I very much hope this is out of choice not out of obligation.", "My husband is wonderful, and I have no doubt he is the better person to take the lead in raising our children. However he is applauded for things that are just expected of mothers. Everything from not leaving me when I was pregnant, to taking a child to a sporting event, to tying our daughter\u2019s hair in a messy ponytail is met with exuberant praise.", "As for my under-promise and over-perform? It has been a long time since I have worn hot pants. However I was told by a senior colleague that her heart sank when she found out I had children, but she was pleasantly surprised that I work really hard and didn\u2019t expect to leave work by 5pm every day. I find my children being my new \u201cunder-promise\u201d really sad."], "tags": ["Home", "Workplace"]},

{"name": "Brooke", "date": "29th October 2018", "text": ["in 9th grade i took a spanish class and in that class i had several incidents. i sat at a group table with 3 other boys, all of them in 10th grade. they would constantly harass me and to the point where if i even became mildly upset they\u2019d bash me saying \u201cwe\u2019re just joking\u201d. one incident was when i was trying to get out of my seat which was boxed in so that i had to climb out, as i climbed out the boy next to me slapped my ass causing the group to erupt in laughter and congratulate him. throughout the year they would press me about topics such as, do i masturbate, what\u2019s my bra size, have i had sex, do i squirt, and other crude questions. i tried my best to ignore them or laugh it off but the more i ignored the questions the more they\u2019d tease me for being a prude and only press harder for answers. i befriended a different boy who sat farther away from me after we were paired up as partners for a project. he was a very talented artist and loved to draw things for me and bring them to class to show me. after the project he found out that i sat alone at lunch and one day just sat next to me and began talking. i eat alone for a reason and that is because i prefer to watch videos and not be obligated to speak, so him sitting next to me made me very uncomfortable. i engaged in conversation with him just to avoid the awkward silence, but after that lunch he started sitting with me everyday, and our conversations took a dark turn. he began venting to me about his abusive mother and how his brothers beat him up everyday. i of course wasn\u2019t sure how to react, i tried to comfort him the best i could by just allowing him to talk and listening. he told me he suffered from BPD and then showed me all the cuts along his arms. i was shocked and mortified how he would just share all of this personal information to me when we\u2019ve only known each other for maybe 3 weeks. that\u2019s what my lunches usually were like with him, therapy sessions, it went on for 2 months until one day. instead of sitting next to me with a comfort gap between us, this lunch he decided to scoot close enough that our thighs touched. i felt this feeling i\u2019ve never felt before, fear in the pit of my stomach. i was trapped, i couldn\u2019t leave all the tables were full and there\u2019s nowhere to go. i continued talking to him ignoring how close we were and try to convince myself maybe he didn\u2019t realize what he\u2019d done. suddenly i felt a strong hand grip my upper thigh and simply stay. i looked at him and he acted normal just eating his lunch with his other hand. i felt powerless and weak, as if in this lunch room full of students was nothing and it was just me and him alone. i froze up and looked around for options unsure of what to do since nobody had ever touched me like this before and i was not enjoying it one bit. i regained control of my body and bolted upright to my feet and grabbed my lunched declaring that i had to leave. i walked quickly to the exit and to the bathroom. i sat down on the bathroom floor and began to cry feeling as though i had done something shameful. should i have accepted his advances? was i in the wrong? those thoughts raced through my head as i sobbed. after that day i ate lunch in the library and never really told anyone, afraid that they\u2019d ridicule me for being so sensitive and overreacting."], "tags": ["Public space", "School"]},
