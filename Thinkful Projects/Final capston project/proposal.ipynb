    "    * Movie reviews are subjective attitudes, emotions and opinions of people and a sentiment extracts information from these reviews. This sentiment analysis will neatly categorize people's sentiment as positive, negative or neutral and provide a topic summary. \n",

    "\n",
    "* <h6>How is your solution valuable?</h6>\n",
    "    * Movie rating doesn't capture the nuances of the opinions and no one wants to sit and read thousands of reviews. These insights can be used to business decisions such as direct marketing, recommendation system, future project directions.\n",

    "\t* Web scraping is new to me and it seems you need some understanding of web development.\n",
    "\t* Feature creation: sentence negation, sarcasm, terseness, language ambiguity, slang, misspellings, and many others make this task very challenging.\n",
    "\t* Neural Network optimization: adjusting hyperparameters\n",
    "    * Evaluating results: first stragey is to compare it to existing ratings.\n"
